        <h3>Five Things to Consider Before You Apply for a Pet</h3>
        <p>Adopting a pet is a life-changing decision. To help make sure you’re ready, here are five questions to ask yourself.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Is now the right time to adopt a pet?</strong></p>
        <p>A pet is a long-term commitment. A dog or cat, for example, could be in your life for 15 - 20 years! So it’s important to think
             about how they fit into your future, not just your present. 
             For instance, if you plan to have children, move to another country, separate from your partner or move house, we’d encourage
             you to adopt a pet after you’ve settled into your new lifestyle. Or, depending on your timelines, perhaps you could give an 
             older pet the loving home they deserve.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Can you afford to look after a pet? </strong></p>
        <p>Pets are a big financial commitment and thousands end up being rehomed because their owners can’t afford to keep them. This can 
            be devastating for pets and their humans… So when it comes to money, try to act from your head and not your heart! 
            Things like vets bills, food, grooming, spaying and neutering, microchipping, insurance, and pet-sitting soon add up. Please be
            honest about whether or not you’re able and willing to cover these costs without putting yourself in financial difficulty. </p>   
        <p><strong>3.How much time and attention can you give a pet?</strong></p>
        <p>All pets need your time and attention. And even though some are more demanding than others, they all need you on a daily basis! 
            If you travel a lot for work or if you’re out the house a lot, adopting a pet is probably not the right thing to do. Even if you 
            work from home or only go away once or twice a year, you’ll still have to make arrangements for your pet to be looked after at 
            some point. Be sure you’re prepared to find and, if necessary, pay for appropriate care when you’re at work or away. </p> 
        <p><strong>4. Are you ready for any hard times? </strong></p>
        <p>When you adopt a pet, you may not have any teething problems at all. But sometimes it can take a while for everyone to adjust… 
           Remember your new pet won’t understand what’s going on or why they’re moving to a new home. They could be confused, distressed 
            or even grieving…  They may need time to settle down, come out of their shell, or get used to a new environment and people. 
            Even though this is completely normal, it’s important to know that the first few weeks or months could be challenging or not 
            match your expectations. Are you prepared to take the rough with the smooth? If not, pet parenthood probably isn’t for you.
            </p> 
        <p><strong>5. Will your new pet fit in with other members of your household?</strong></p>            
        <p>If you live with other people or already have pets, you should be confident that a new pet will fit in. All two-legged and 
            four-legged members of your household must be comfortable with a new addition, have realistic expectations and know how to 
            behave appropriately when any new pet arrives. Also make sure that no one has pet hair allergies and, if you rent your home, 
            you’ll need to have written permission from your landlord! 
            If you have any doubts about this, we suggest you wait until the situation changes. </p>
        <h2>And finally... Are you ready to adopt a pet?</h2>
        <p>Now you’ve asked yourself these five questions, it’s time to decide if you’re ready to welcome a pet into your life. If the 
            answer is ‘yes’, then start searching now!</p>
        <p>If the answer is ‘no’, you should be proud of yourself for being honest and realistic. Remember there’s no rush and you’ll 
            probably be ready to adopt one day. And when you are, PetRehomer will be right here.</p>
